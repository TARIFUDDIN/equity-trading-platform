# 🌌 EQUINOX-AI  
### The Autonomous Financial Singularity  
**Where Quantitative Execution Meets Generative Reasoning**

Equinox-AI is not just a trading bot.  
It is a **dual-core financial operating system** that merges autonomous trading agents with a deep-research financial analyst, unified under a single **institutional-grade terminal**.

## 🦅 Executive Summary

Modern markets suffer from **information overload but insight scarcity**.  
Equinox-AI solves this by simulating a **complete hedge fund stack in software**.

### 🔹 Key Capabilities
- **Autonomous Execution**  
  A committee of 4 AI traders (Warren, George, Ray, Cathie) debate, decide, and execute trades independently using the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**.

- **Deep Financial Research**  
  A LangGraph-powered analyst uses **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer complex questions using verified internal PDFs — not hallucinations.

- **Live Market Intelligence**  
  Integrated web scrapers analyze **Finviz & MarketWatch** sentiment to filter false signals in real time.

## 🏗️ System Architecture

Equinox-AI uses a **decoupled, event-driven architecture** so the Trading Engine never blocks the Research Engine.

## The Dual-Core Engine

Equinox-AI is built around a dual-core architecture that cleanly separates execution from research.

### Core A: Trading Floor (Execution Layer)

A committee of autonomous trading agents, each operating with a distinct market philosophy and risk profile.

| Agent   | Model            | Strategy                                   | Risk Level |
|--------|------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------|
| Warren | Claude-3-Opus    | Value investing and fundamentals            | Low       |
| George | Gemini-Pro       | Momentum and news reflexivity               | High      |
| Ray    | Mistral-Large    | Quant indicators (RSI, MACD)                | Medium    |
| Cathie | GPT-4            | High-beta growth and innovation strategies  | Very High |

---

### Core B: Intelligence Hub (Research Layer)

A research-focused intelligence engine responsible for financial analysis, advisory, and contextual reasoning.

**Capabilities**
- Intent routing (stock / fund / advisory)
- Live NAV and AUM scraping
- PDF-based RAG citations
- Sentiment-aware market analysis

**Example Queries**
- `Compare HDFC Flexi Cap vs Parag Parikh`
- `What is our hedging strategy?`
